# Tribal-Wars-bot
bot written in python to build buildings, gather usefull information etc.

Just simply open file and insert your server, name, passwd, url;   also i have attached chromedriver which is used by selenium module !( this is different for different OS, if you have not windows 10 then simply download chromium browser for your OS, and insert absolute path into python code).
I wrote this code when i was boring to click and play Tribal Wars, so it is not a perfect structured code, but at least it does something and it works.

If there are any problems, please contact me on github.
time.sleep() In code is used to wait until page is loaded so you can enlarge this time.

Notice that in some time there may be changes in game processing post, get data requests used in code, if so, you can try to repair it or comment part which does not working.
